# Knowledge Stack
This is a basic application for managing acquired knowledge (books, basically).

### Technology Used

- `Node.js` backend;
- `Express.js` for API route management;
- `NEO4J` graph database;
- `AWS S3` for content storage and delivery;
- `React` frontend;

This `README.md` file will also be updated as I arrange the whole project more neatly.

**note** accidentally commited /node_modules, don't think there's any changing that now :(

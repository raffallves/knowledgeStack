# Knowledge Stack
This is a basic application for managing acquired knowledge (books, basically).

It's a bit of a mess now because I started by using MongoDB then switched to NEO4J, but in the next few weeks I'll be handling and sorting everything out.

### Technology Used

- `Node.js` backend;
- `Express.js` for API route management;
- `NEO4J` graph database;
- AWS S3 for content storage and delivery;
- `React` frontend;

This `README.md` file will also be updated as I arrange the whole project more neatly.
